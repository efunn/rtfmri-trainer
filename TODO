- Reach target:
    - N trials of each type
    - 8 types of trial 2x2x2: (hrf)x(visible)x(dof)
                              (t/f)x(t/f)x(1/2)
    - 2s TR w/ 'm' noise from cts/term
    * Questions:
        * what would minimum N be?
        * what would maximum N be?
        * can we have less trials of the easy one?
            * ask stats guy: 5 trials of each?
        try 20 trials, tweak to get:
        (2+2+6+6+8+16+16+32)*2*20/60
    # ToDo:
        # code cleanup
        # start from left side/bottom left-hand corner
        # ability to pause
        # indication to go back to start circle
- Cts/term:
    - N trials of each type
    - 4 types of trial: 2x2 (noise)x(TR)
                            (l/h)x(2/20)
    - 1 DOF 
    - 2 min per trial -- might have to tweak target size 
                                             or noise level

    * Questions:
        * N at 7 (56min)
        * relationship between noise variance and taking the mean
        * case 1: generate noise at variance s
        * case 2: generate 10 samples of noise at variance 10*s
                  and then take the mean   
- Playback:
    - N trials of each type
    - 2 DOF
    - 2 types of trial: traditional vs. replay
        - 4 min per trial (tentative)
        - 6 playback blocks per trial (tentative)
        - ** try to make playback really really good
    * Questions:
        * which 'traditional' experiment type to choose? 2s TR and 'm' noise?
        * how long to figure out 2 DOF target? Tweak trial length based on this.
        * N at 8
